### Mimosa and Storytelling
The Mimosa pudica also captured the attention of writers and storytellers in addition to scientists. In 1791 Erasmus Darwin (link) described the Mimosa pudica in his poem The Loves of the Plants, the second of two poems aimed at educating the public in botany and taxonomy. The Loves of the Plants animates Linneanian classification by anthropomorphized flowers. However, considering Linnaean taxonomy relies on sexual difference and reproduction for classification, the poems read as quite scandalous at times. Here the Mimosa pudica fascinates not only for its movement but for its reproduction. The mimosa, carrying both male and female reproductive organs on a single plant does not need a partner to reproduce. The combination of the plant's movement and reproduction leads Darwin to describe the plant as chaste, avoiding “rude touches” and “feels, alive through all her tender form.”Darwin writes further about the Mimosa pudica beyond his poem, describing his own puzzlement and experimentation with the plant. He writes   
"…I have found, when touched in the night during their sleep, they fall still further; especially when touched on the foot-stalks between the stems and the leaflets, which seems to be their most sensitive or irritable part. Now as their situation after being exposed to external violence resembles their sleep, but with a greater degree of collapse, may it not be owing to a numbness or paralysis consequent to too violent irritation, like the faintings of animals from pain or fatigue?" It is telling that Darwin describes the external stimuli toward the plant as violence on multiple occasions especially considering Darwin himself makes attempts to replicate this violence in the plants most “sensitive or irritable part.” Darwin, when shown a plant’s capacity to feel, responds by experimenting how far and to what extent. This is further demonstrated when Darwin keeps a Mimosa pudica in a dark room to observe the plant “sleeping.” Darwin concludes that the plant feels, sleeps, and possibly faints like an animal. Although the primary purpose of The Loves of the Plants is poetry making accessible scientific language, Darwin cannot help but relay his own experimentation, highlighting the mesmerism of the Mimosa.

[_Ilexparaguariensis_](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:315555-2) is an evergreen shrub or tree native to the subtropical forests of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="41.1639626960103, -104.75241434618096">natal</span>that can grow up to forty-nine feet tall. It’s a plant species of the genus ilex (or “holly”) that contains caffeine as well as other alkaloid components, and it has stimulant, diuretic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties that made it attractive to both the indigenous Guaraní people and to Spanish colonial settlers. After being dried, roasted, and powdered, mate leaves are used to prepare a hot or cold beverage, also known as mate or Paraguayan Tea. The loose powder is typically steeped in hot water and strained through a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="396,798,939,417">metallic straw</span>, or bombilla, shared by many people, passing from mouth to mouth. During the 19th century, the drink became associated with South American *gauchos*. The same mate and bombilla are shared in social gatherings, a habit that has endured despite recent public health campaigns to prevent COVID-19 pandemic.
