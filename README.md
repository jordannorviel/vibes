### Mimosa and Storytelling, Erasmus Darwin 
The Mimosa pudica also captured the attention of writers and storytellers in addition to scientists. In 1791 Erasmus Darwin (link) described the Mimosa pudica in his poem The Loves of the Plants, the second of two poems aimed at educating the public in botany and taxonomy. The Loves of the Plants animates Linneanian classification by anthropomorphized flowers. However, considering Linnaean taxonomy relies on sexual difference and reproduction for classification, the poems read as quite scandalous at times. Here the Mimosa pudica fascinates not only for its movement but for its reproduction. The mimosa, carrying both male and female reproductive organs on a single plant does not need a partner to reproduce. The combination of the plant's movement and reproduction leads Darwin to describe the plant as chaste, avoiding “rude touches” and “feels, alive through all her tender form.”Darwin writes further about the Mimosa pudica beyond his poem, describing his own puzzlement and experimentation with the plant. He writes   
"…I have found, when touched in the night during their sleep, they fall still further; especially when touched on the foot-stalks between the stems and the leaflets, which seems to be their most sensitive or irritable part. Now as their situation after being exposed to external violence resembles their sleep, but with a greater degree of collapse, may it not be owing to a numbness or paralysis consequent to too violent irritation, like the faintings of animals from pain or fatigue?" It is telling that Darwin describes the external stimuli toward the plant as violence on multiple occasions especially considering Darwin himself makes attempts to replicate this violence in the plants most “sensitive or irritable part.” Darwin, when shown a plant’s capacity to feel, responds by experimenting how far and to what extent. This is further demonstrated when Darwin keeps a Mimosa pudica in a dark room to observe the plant “sleeping.” Darwin concludes that the plant feels, sleeps, and possibly faints like an animal. Although the primary purpose of The Loves of the Plants is poetry making accessible scientific language, Darwin cannot help but relay his own experimentation, highlighting the mesmerism of the Mimosa.

### Percy Shelley
It is precisely the Mimosa pudica’s otherworldly capacity to feel that captures Percy Shelley’s attention. One of his last written works, “The Sensitive Plant” embraces the plant’s all consuming affect. Told in three parts, the poem begins similarly to Darwin’s with the sensitive plant growing “companionless” in the garden. In the second part Shelley introduces the gardener, a similarly solitary woman who dedicates herself to her plants. The gardener, where companionless, is adored by the garden. Shelley writes “I doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet/Rejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet;/I doubt not they felt the spirit that came/From her glowing fingers through all their frame.”(140-145). Here Shelley is speculating that the flowers themselves cared for the women that tended to them. In return, she is so devoted to that garden that “If the flowers had been her own infants, she/Could never have nursed them more tenderly”(153-155). In the very last line of this section, the woman abruptly dies leaving the garden to mourn in the third section. Her plants left alone become overgrown and decay with the exception of the sensitive plant who “Wept, and the tears within each lid/Of its folded leaves, which together grew,/Were changed to a blight of frozen glue” (253-255). The plant here is remarkable for its capacity to feel and mourn. Theresa Kelley, speaking to Shelley’s departure from Darwin’s sexual classification, writes “Shelley’s Sensitive-plant is an “it,” but it is an it who loves what it has not. In the language of Shelley’s poem, requiring no sexual companion to reproduce is hardly if at all at issue. What matters is rather its capacity for feeling” (Kelley 211-212). The Mimosa pudica here is significant not as a scientific oddity but as something that has an other worldly capacity to feel. This deep sense of affect is all the more moving when considering Shelley wrote this poem at a particularly devastating point in his life where he was chronically ill and mourning the loss of a child.

[_Ilexparaguariensis_](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:315555-2) is an evergreen shrub or tree native to the subtropical forests of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="41.1639626960103, -104.75241434618096">natal</span>that can grow up to forty-nine feet tall. It’s a plant species of the genus ilex (or “holly”) that contains caffeine as well as other alkaloid components, and it has stimulant, diuretic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties that made it attractive to both the indigenous Guaraní people and to Spanish colonial settlers. After being dried, roasted, and powdered, mate leaves are used to prepare a hot or cold beverage, also known as mate or Paraguayan Tea. The loose powder is typically steeped in hot water and strained through a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="396,798,939,417">metallic straw</span>, or bombilla, shared by many people, passing from mouth to mouth. During the 19th century, the drink became associated with South American *gauchos*. The same mate and bombilla are shared in social gatherings, a habit that has endured despite recent public health campaigns to prevent COVID-19 pandemic.
